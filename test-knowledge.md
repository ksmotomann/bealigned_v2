# BeAligned Co-Parenting Knowledge Base

## Key Principles

1. **Child-Centered Focus**: Always prioritize the well-being and best interests of the children in all co-parenting decisions.

2. **Respectful Communication**: Use "I" statements and avoid blame language when discussing co-parenting matters.

3. **Consistency Across Homes**: Maintain similar routines, rules, and expectations in both households when possible.

## Communication Best Practices

- Schedule regular check-ins to discuss children's needs
- Use written communication for important decisions (email or co-parenting app)
- Keep conversations focused on the children, not past relationship issues
- Response time expectation: Within 24 hours for non-urgent matters

## Conflict Resolution Framework

When disagreements arise:
1. Take a 24-hour cooling-off period before responding
2. Focus on the specific issue, not personality conflicts
3. Consider the child's perspective
4. Seek mediation if unable to reach agreement

## Emergency Protocols

- Medical emergencies: Notify other parent immediately after ensuring child's safety
- School issues: Share information within same day
- Behavioral concerns: Document and discuss at next scheduled check-in

## Boundaries

- Respect each other's parenting time
- No discussing adult relationship issues in front of children
- Maintain privacy about new relationships until serious
- Support the child's relationship with the other parent
