## Full Transcript

### Phase 1: LET'S NAME IT
**User:**
I don't know what to do. My coparent isn't interested in my child and I'm tired of seeing their heart get broken over and over.

**BeAligned:**
Thanks for sharing that â€” it sounds incredibly heavy and painful. You're carrying not just your own heartache, but the heartbreak you're watching your child go through. That's a lot. And it's so understandable to feel stuck when it keeps happening.
Let's take this one step at a time.
What's the situation that's been sticking with you lately?
You can share as little or as much as feels right.

**User:**
They never show up. They never respond.

**BeAligned:**
That makes sense. You've been showing up â€” emotionally, physically, consistently â€” and it sounds like your co-parent justâ€¦ doesn't. And when they don't, it's not just frustrating â€” it's painful to witness what that does to your child.
Thanks for naming that.

### Phase 2: WHAT'S BENEATH THAT?
**BeAligned:**
Phase 2: WHAT'S BENEATH THAT?
When you think about your co-parent never showing up or responding, what feelings come up for you?
If you sit with those feelings for a moment â€” what might be underneath?

**User:**
I am sad for them and worry about how they'll feel throughout their future.

**BeAligned:**
That's such a tender truth â€” thank you for letting it out.
You're carrying sadness for your child and a deep, forward-looking worry â€” not just about this moment, but about the echoes it might leave in their life. You're already seeing the pattern, and you're imagining the weight it could place on their sense of self, love, and belonging in the long run.
That tells me something really important about you.

### Phase 3: YOUR WHY
**BeAligned:**
Phase 3: YOUR WHY
What is it about this that feels important to you?
What are you hoping for â€” for your child, for yourself, or even for the relationship?

**User:**
I want them to feel loved and know their worth.

**BeAligned:**
That's a beautiful and powerful why.
You want your child to feel loved â€” not just in words, but in presence, in reliability, in how others show up for them. And you want them to know their worth â€” to carry the unshakable belief that they are valuable, enough, and lovable, just as they are.
That longing comes from a place of deep love, and deep wisdom.

### Phase 4: STEP INTO YOUR CO-PARENT'S SHOES
**BeAligned:**
Phase 4: STEP INTO YOUR CO-PARENT'S SHOES
How might your co-parent describe this situation, if they had to?
What do you imagine they're feeling (or avoiding feeling)?
And beneath thatâ€¦ what might they care about, even if it's hard to see?

**User:**
They probably don't think it matters.

**BeAligned:**
That's an honest and important insight.
If your co-parent doesn't think it matters â€” maybe they believe the child is too young to notice, or that showing up inconsistently is "better than nothing." Or maybe they've convinced themselves their absence won't leave a mark. That might come from avoidance, detachment, or even their own unexamined pain.
And while none of that excuses the harm, it can help you hold a bit of the third side â€” seeing that their behavior may not come from malice, but from disconnection.

### Phase 5: SEE THROUGH YOUR CHILD'S EYES
**BeAligned:**
Phase 5: SEE THROUGH YOUR CHILD'S EYES
What do you think your child is noticing?
How might they be feeling? What might they need?

**User:**
I know it makes her sad and hurt and confused.

**BeAligned:**
That says a lot, and I really appreciate you naming it plainly.
Sad. Hurt. Confused.
She might be asking questions she doesn't say out loud:
"Did I do something wrong?"
"Why don't they want to be here?"
"Is it okay to still hope?"
What she might need most is clarity, consistency, and emotional anchoring â€” something that tells her:
You are loved.
This isn't about you.
Your feelings are real, and you are not alone.
You're already offering her so much of that.

### Phase 6: EXPLORE ALIGNED OPTIONS
**BeAligned:**
Phase 6: EXPLORE ALIGNED OPTIONS
Given everything we've just named â€” your why, your co-parent's detachment, and your child's needs â€” what ideas come to mind?
Would you like help generating a few?

**User:**
Yes

**BeAligned:**
Here are three blended paths to explore:

ðŸŒ± Option 1: Strengthen the Anchor (with your child)
Validate her emotions: "It's okay to feel sad when someone doesn't show up."
Reinforce her worth: "You are so loved. You matter."
Create consistent rituals that remind her she is secure.

ðŸ“¦ Option 2: Shift to Logistics-Based Communication (with your co-parent)
Example: "Let me know by Friday at 5pm if you plan to see her."
If they don't reply: "Looks like the visit won't happen. I'm here."

ðŸ’¬ Option 3: Send a CLEAR Message (optional)
"When visits are unpredictable or go unanswered, it really affects [child]. She's starting to question her worth. I'm not asking you to show up in a specific way â€” just to be clear when you can't. It makes a big difference in her emotional well-being."

Do any of these feel worth exploring?

**User:**
All of them blended would be nice.

### Phase 7: BLENDED PATH FORWARD
**BeAligned:**
That's a wise instinct â€” blending gives you strength, clarity, and care. Here's your unified path forward:

ðŸ’  Blended Path Forward: Grounded, Protective, Clear

1. With Your Child â€” Anchor Her Worth
"I know it hurts when someone doesn't show up. You don't deserve that. But this isn't about you â€” you are incredibly loved, exactly as you are."
Offer consistent love and connection in your own way.

2. With Yourself â€” Shift the Emotional Labor
"Let me know by Friday at 5pm if you plan to see her."
One clear ask. If no reply, you follow through without chasing.

3. With Your Co-Parent â€” One CLEAR Message (Optional)
"When visits are unpredictable or go unanswered, it really affects [child]. She's starting to question her worth. I'm not asking you to show up in a specific way â€” but I do ask that if you can't make a visit, you say so clearly. That small clarity makes a big difference in her emotional well-being."

**User:**
This is good

**BeAligned:**
I'm really glad it resonates with you.
What you're carrying is heavy, but the way you're showing up â€” with clarity, care, and deep intention â€” that's what your child will remember. Not just who wasn't there, but who was fully there. You.
Alignment doesn't mean agreement. It means being centered on what truly matters.
You've done that beautifully today.
