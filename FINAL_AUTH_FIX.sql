Subject: CRITICAL - Auth System Broken - Need Column Removed

Project ID: qujysevuyhqyitxqctxg
Project URL: https://qujysevuyhqyitxqctxg.supabase.co

ISSUE:
A custom column "is_super_admin" was added to auth.users table.
This breaks ALL authentication with error: "Database error querying schema"

IMPACT:
- No users can log in
- Password reset fails  
- New user registration fails
- Admin functions broken

REQUIRED FIX:
Please run: ALTER TABLE auth.users DROP COLUMN is_super_admin;

We cannot run this ourselves due to: ERROR 42501: permission denied for schema auth

This is blocking all application functionality. Please help urgently.

Thank you!
