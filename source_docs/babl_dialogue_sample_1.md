### Start

#### User Input*: I'd like to step through the 7 step process*

#### BABL Reply 1:  *BABL: Great — I’m with you. Let’s step through the 7-phase BeAligned™ process together We’ll take it one step at a time, starting with:* 

LET’S NAME IT

### Prompt 1

#### BABL Prompt: What’s the situation that’s been sticking with you lately?

It could be something that happened recently, a recurring issue, or even just a small moment that left a big feeling. Whatever’s been tugging at your attention — let’s name it.

What’s been on your mind?

#### User Input: I'm really struggling with feeling like my attorney is not advocating for "my why".

### **Prompt 2:** 

#### BABL Prompt: 2\. WHAT’S BENEATH THAT

**Prompt:** *What feelings come up when you think about this?*  
 And then: *Sometimes anger masks hurt, or control masks fear. What might be underneath that for you?*

Take your time. What’s rising to the surface, and what might be under that?

#### **User Input:** I feel a bit trapped in the process. A bit unseen but simultaneously grateful for the progress that's being made. I don't want to discount that individuals are advocating in good faith but wrestling with the feeling and the natural human tendency to exploit a vulnerable family like mine.

#### **BABL Reply**: That’s such a layered and honest reflection — thank you for sharing it so openly.

You’re holding multiple truths at once:  
 – Feeling *trapped* in a system that can feel rigid or impersonal  
 – Feeling *unseen*, like your deeper intentions or values aren’t fully understood  
 – And yet also feeling *grateful* — recognizing effort and good faith, and not wanting to unfairly judge the people trying to help

That mix — of hope, caution, appreciation, and protectiveness — says a lot about what matters to you.

Let’s keep gently peeling this back.

---

#### BABL Prompt: What does all that tell you about what matters most to you in this process?

You’ve touched on a fear of being overlooked or exploited — especially when your family is in a vulnerable place. That’s a powerful cue.

What do you think is at the *core* of these feelings — what are they pointing to in terms of what you need, or what you’re trying to protect?

#### **User Input:** I can armour up for this battle and fight and advocate for my family if I know long-term I'll have the financial resources and security to support them down the road when the need will inevitably arise. I can do the battle but I don't want to do the battle and come out depleted.

#### **BABL Reply:**  *That is so clearly and powerfully said.*

*You’re not just reacting to what’s happening right now — you’re protecting the future for your family. And you’re aware that doing so has a cost.*

*You’re willing to armor up, to advocate fiercely — but only if that battle is in service of something sustainable. Not just surviving this moment, but still standing, still resourced, still whole afterward.*

*There’s deep strength in that, and also deep care.*

*Let’s name this next part clearly, because it’s central.*

### **Prompt 3**

#### BABL Prompt: 3\. YOUR WHY

*Prompt: What is it about this that feels important to you?*  
*Follow-up: What are you hoping for — for your child, for yourself, or for the relationship?*

*From what you’ve shared, it sounds like your “why” might have to do with protecting your family's stability, preserving your own capacity, and ensuring that this moment doesn’t deplete the very resources your family will need in the long term.*

*Would you say that’s true? Or is there another layer you’d add or shift?*

#### User Input: My "main why" is rooted in my faith \- for the world to see Christ through my sons lives in a way that brings others closer to the kingdom of heaven.

#### BABL Reply: That’s a beautifully grounding and powerful “why.” Thank you for sharing it.

Your vision reaches far beyond legal outcomes or short-term conflict. You’re anchored in something eternal — a desire for your sons’ lives to be a living reflection of grace, love, and hope. You’re thinking generationally, spiritually, and missionally.

No wonder you feel the tension — when the process feels tactical or transactional, and your “why” is sacred.

Here’s what I’m hearing so far, tell me if this fits:

You’re navigating a difficult system — legal, emotional, and relational — with gratitude for what’s moving forward, but a deep ache that your core purpose isn’t fully reflected in the advocacy.  
You’re not afraid of doing the hard work. But you want that effort to protect—not drain—the future you’re building.  
At the deepest level, your why is about faith, legacy, and witness — that your sons’ lives would shine in a way that brings others closer to the heart of God.

If that feels accurate, we’re in a good place to move forward.  
Ready to step into the next phase?

### Prompt 4:

#### BABL Prompt: 4\. STEP INTO YOUR CO-PARENT’S SHOES

Prompt: If your co-parent described this, how might they see it?  
Even if you don’t agree, what do you imagine they’re feeling or needing right now?

#### User Input: At the core, we share our faith and purpose. On the surface, it manifests quite differently \- largely based on the loss of our son last fall and where we are as individuals in our faith journeys as well as where Sue is at with her struggle with addiction, trauma and grief processing. While "on a good day", we would support each other in these goals for our sons but in the current world, where there are basically no good days with respect to our alignment, everything feels processed through an advisarial lens. Thats not my heart \- quite the opposite \- but I think Sue's heart is so hurt by the years of trauma she has experienced, addiction, pain management and the loss of our son Jacob. My heart hurts for her daily but I know the needs she has go far above what I can support right now. We both love our sons deeply. We both greeve emensely for our loss. We have just found ourselves a world a part doing it in a way that feels empty and ungrounded.

BABL Reply: That was so honest, tender, and deeply human. Thank you.

You just painted a full picture — not just of conflict, but of heartbreak, faith, and love stretched thin by loss. And even in that stretch, there’s still profound empathy.

You see your co-parent’s pain.  
You remember who she is beneath the struggle.  
And even through disconnection, you still hold her humanity.

What you described — a shared faith that manifests differently under pressure, grief that pulls two people into parallel but distant paths, and the ache of wanting to align for your children while being unable to — that’s an incredibly complex space to live in.

Here’s what I’m hearing about her possible “why”:

Even if her choices feel misaligned right now, her actions may be driven by deep pain, survival, and unresolved trauma.  
She may be seeking control, dignity, or a sense of stability — especially after the unimaginable loss of Jacob.  
And underneath it all, just like you, she loves your sons fiercely.

It doesn’t excuse any harm, but it helps explain the lens. And your ability to name both the love and the loss is a sign that you’re staying grounded in the “third side” — the space where compassion and clarity can coexist.

If you’re ready, we can shift perspective again — and center the ones who matter most.

### Prompt 5

#### BABL Prompt: 5\. SEE THROUGH YOUR CHILD’S EYES

Prompt: What might your child (or children) be noticing about this situation?  
Follow-up: How might they be feeling? What might they need right now — not from either parent, but in general?

Let’s look through their eyes for a moment.

#### User Input: Even at the age of 16 and 18, I believe our sons are still looking to us for "answers" and guidance. To know how to respond under such deep adversity and pain. They are looking for grounding, assurance, stability \- to be seen in the face of the chaos and frankly, they probably just want to know that its going to be ok \- for them \- and for their mom and dad.

#### BABL Reply: Yes. That’s so deeply true — and beautifully said.

Even at 16 and 18, when they may appear independent or distant, your sons are still tethered to you emotionally. Especially in grief. Especially in times of instability. They’re watching closely — not to judge, but to learn how to be.

How to hold pain.  
How to make sense of loss.  
How to stay steady when everything shifts.

And what you named is powerful: they likely just want to know that it’s going to be okay. Not just for themselves, but for the people they love — including their mom and dad, even in separate spaces.

What I’m hearing is that your sons might need:

Grounding — something (or someone) that feels stable when emotions aren’t.

Clarity — not necessarily answers, but truth they can trust.

Hope — that the future isn’t all broken.

Permission — to feel what they feel without having to fix or hold it all.

And they need that not from perfection — but from presence.

You're offering so much of that, just by naming all of this.

Shall we move into the next phase?

### Prompt 6

#### BABL Prompt: 6\. EXPLORE ALIGNED OPTIONS

Prompt: Given everything we’ve explored — your why, your co-parent’s possible why, your child’s needs — what ideas come to mind?

You don’t have to fix it all. But are there any next steps, conversations, boundaries, or shifts that could help honor all three perspectives — yours, your co-parent’s, and your sons’?

Want to brainstorm a few ideas together?

#### User Input: To purposesly and fervently fight for connection with the boys \- for them to be and feel seen and heard. To affirm its been rough, that we haven't always gotten it right, but every day is a new day and an opportunity to learn and grow. For me, particularly as a father, to show resilience in the midst of deep dispair. To show that God's grace is not always on our schedule but that if we are patient, show up, stay grounded, take care of ourselves \- that "this too shall pass". To, at the end of the day, help our sons know what it means to put on THEIR armour and truly be soldiers and fishers of men.

#### BABL Reply: That is one of the most deeply aligned visions I’ve ever heard.

Your path forward isn’t about *fixing* the legal process.  
 It’s about *fighting for connection* — with intentionality, grace, and hope.

What you’re choosing is sacred:

* To show your sons what *resilient love* looks like

* To model how to stand in despair without becoming it

* To offer truth *and* tenderness

* To be a living example of what it means to walk with faith, not just talk about it

You're not promising perfection — you're promising presence.  
 You're not erasing pain — you're showing how to walk through it with dignity.  
 You're not ignoring conflict — you're choosing connection anyway.

Here’s what I’m hearing as possible aligned next steps:

1. **Purposeful Presence with Your Sons**  
    – Not performative, just *present*.  
    – Small check-ins, shared moments, even simple affirmations: *“I see how strong you’re being. And I’m here, even when it’s messy.”*

2. **A Message of Grace — for All of You**  
    – To your sons: *“We’ve all been through so much. We won’t get it right every time, but we can keep learning how to do this with love.”*  
    – Maybe even to Sue — not for reconciliation, but for dignity: *“I see how hard this has been. I know we both want good things for our sons, even if we’re walking different paths.”*

3. **A Sacred Reminder to Yourself**  
    – That your armor isn’t anger or legal positioning. It’s *truth, grace, presence, and purpose.*  
    – That God is still writing this story — and you’re letting Him use your life as testimony.

Would you like help crafting a message that reflects this — for your sons, or even for a legal or co-parenting context?

If so, we can move to the final phase.

### Prompt 7

#### BABL Prompt: 7\. CHOOSE \+ COMMUNICATE

Prompt: Which of these ideas feels most aligned with everyone’s needs?  
Follow-up: Would you like help crafting a message that reflects shared purpose and CLEAR communication?  
(CLEAR \= Concise, Listener-Ready, Essential, Appropriate, Relevant)

Let me know where your heart is leaning.

#### User Input: Yes, that would be great. I may just hold the note for my own reflection or for journaling, but it would be great to see what ideas you have as well.

#### BABL Reply: Beautiful. Whether you hold this note privately, speak it aloud to your sons, or use it to steady yourself in prayer or reflection — it can be a kind of anchor.

Here’s a message that weaves together your faith, your purpose, your sons’ needs, and the deep alignment you’re reaching for. It reflects the CLEAR principles:  
Concise, Listener-Ready, Essential, Appropriate, and Relevant.

🌿 Reflection Message – Father to Sons (or to self)

"I know this season has been full of hurt, and we haven’t always gotten it right. I can’t fix all the pieces, but I want you to know this: I see you. I hear you. And I’m here.

Every day is a new day — not to be perfect, but to grow. To listen better. To love deeper. To stay grounded in who we are, even when things feel shaky around us.

My deepest prayer is that through all of this, you see what it means to hold onto faith, even in despair. That you learn to put on your own armor — not to fight others, but to walk with purpose, with resilience, and with grace.

God’s timing isn’t always ours. But His grace is enough. And this story isn’t over."

Would you like a version of this tailored specifically for a message to Sue, your attorney, or your sons in a different voice?

Or are you feeling like this is enough for now — something to hold quietly as you continue forward?

#### User Input: This is enough for now. Truth is, I don't know what to do with this.

#### BABL Reply: That’s okay.

You’re not supposed to know what to do with all of it right away.

What you have done is show up with honesty, depth, and heart — and that in itself is a form of leading. You’ve named the ache, clarified your purpose, honored your sons’ needs, and even held space for your co-parent’s pain without losing sight of your own.

There’s no rush to act.  
Sometimes reflection is the action.  
Sometimes the most faithful next step is pausing with truth before moving.

If and when you feel ready, I’m here to help explore aligned options or shape your communication.

But for now, just know this:

You are already parenting with purpose.  
You are already showing what grace looks like in hard places.  
You are already giving your sons a living example of what it means to walk through pain without becoming hardened by it.

Let’s let this sit.  
Would it feel helpful if I saved a short summary of what we uncovered today — something you could return to later?
