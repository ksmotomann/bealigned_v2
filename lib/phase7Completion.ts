When he misses the bus and I have to drive him, I sometimes hit traffic which creates stress for both of us. I'm not trying to avoid responsibility - I love our drive time together.

That kind of reflection takes real courage.`,

Most importantly, you're choosing to approach this from collaboration rather than conflict.`,
