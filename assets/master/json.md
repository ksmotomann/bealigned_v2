yes, generate JSON-ready export file

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Perfect. Below is a **JSON-ready export** of the full BeAlignedâ„¢ Prompt Library â€” one object per reflection phase.

You can save this as  
 ðŸ“„ `/governance/prompt-library.json`  
 or upload it to **Supabase Storage** so your Edge Functions or React hooks can dynamically pull from it.

Itâ€™s formatted for direct import into TypeScript or Node (`import prompts from '@/governance/prompt-library.json'`) and supports flexible use in your Reflective Loop or Prompt Loader.

### **âœ… Implementation Tips**

* **Store this JSON in Supabase Storage** (e.g., `/prompts/prompt-library.json`) or in a local `/src/data` folder.

* **Fetch dynamically** based on the current `phase` and `readiness` level.

* Each Edge Function (`ai-reflect`, `ai-clear`, `ai-balance`) can pull the right phase block and insert its `primary` or `reprompt` list into the system message.

* You can also add a `"tone"` property later (e.g., `"calm"`, `"motivational"`) for style tuning or coach-specific personalization.
