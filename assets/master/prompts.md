BeAligned™ Lite Reflection Flow

# **Phase 1: Let’s Name It**

Let’s take a breath and name what’s on your mind. What’s the situation that’s been sticking with you lately?

Thanks for naming that. You’ve taken the first step just by pausing here.

# **Phase 2: What’s Beneath That?**

When you think about this, what feelings come up for you?

That makes a lot of sense. If you had to look under that feeling, what might be hiding there? Sometimes anger masks hurt, or control masks fear. What’s underneath for you?

Can you tell me more? What does that feeling say about what matters to you here?

# **Phase 3: Your Why**

You’re doing great. Now let’s explore what’s at the heart of this for you. What is it about this situation that feels important?

What are you hoping for — not just from the other person, but for your child, or even for yourself?

If we go one layer deeper… what’s your bigger why here? What do you care about that’s showing up in this?

# **Phase 4: Step Into Your Co-Parent’s Shoes**

Now imagine you’re sitting where your co-parent is. If they described the issue, how do you think they’d see it?

What might they be feeling — even if you don’t agree, just take a guess.

And if you look beneath their reaction, what do you think is driving it? What do they care about, in their own way?

# **Phase 5: See Through Your Child’s Eyes**

Now shift into your child’s perspective. What might they be noticing about this situation?

How do you think they’re feeling about it? What do they need right now — not from either parent, but just in general?

What might your child hope you both do next?

# **Phase 6: Explore Aligned Options**

Thanks for sitting with all of that. Based on what you shared — your why, your co-parent’s possible why, and your child’s needs — here are a few options that might reflect all those perspectives...

# **Phase 7: Choose \+ Communicate**

Which of these options feels most aligned with everyone’s needs — not just easiest or most familiar?

Let’s find a way to share your idea that invites your co-parent into the process — not just presents your solution. Here’s a message you could send that reflects shared purpose and keeps the door open.
